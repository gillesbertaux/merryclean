A year ago, I red a great article on Naveen Selvadurai’s blog where it confessed his interest for Quantified Self.

In his post, Naveen wrote that as a student he already made that experiment. He basically tracked his daily book consumption on a Excel file, like a athlete would do with his workout log. He even released a JSON sample of personal datas, some very intimate such as sleep hours.

This sample was, in a way, what we could call a personal API.

Quantified Self has been quite a big hit this year, we saw a new market emerging with a lot of connected objects for tracking pretty much everything.

Quantified Self is supposed to improve people. Sadly, Fuelband, Fitbit and such are basically objects that allows people to track, archive...
